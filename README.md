+ Projec title: Can we be happy on our own?
+ This project is conducted by Gabriel Benedict

+ Project summary: We are provided with more and more opportunities to
  spend our time on virtual platforms. Does that impact our way of
  seeking happiness? Do we resort to those virtual platforms to
  compensate for the lack of an entourage of friends and family or do we
  purposedly use this alone time to ? More generally, are people able
  to be happy on their own? How do those people differ from people who
  feel happy thanks to their surrounding family, friends? This blog
  post uses 100'000 statement about people's happy moments to explore
  and draw inference on that subject.
